        @header CFStorage
CFStorage stores an array of arbitrary-sized values. There are no callbacks;
all that is provided about the values is the size, and the appropriate number
of bytes are copied in and out of the CFStorage.

CFStorage uses a balanced tree to store the values, and is most appropriate
for situations where potentially a large number values (more than a hundred
bytes' worth) will be stored and there will be a lot of editing (insertions and deletions).

Getting to an item is O(log n), although caching the last result often reduces this
to a constant time.

The overhead of CFStorage is 48 bytes. There is no per item overhead; the 
non-leaf nodes in the tree cost 20 bytes each, and the worst case extra
capacity (unused space in the leaves) is 12%, typically much less.

Because CFStorage does not necessarily use a single block of memory to store the values,
when you ask for a value, you get back the pointer to the value and optionally
the range of other values that are consecutive and thus reachable as if the
storage was a single block.
