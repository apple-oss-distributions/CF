/*
All URLs can be broken into two pieces - the scheme (preceding the
first colon) and the resource specifier (following the first colon).
Most URLs are also "standard" URLs conforming to RFC 1808 (available
from www.w3c.org).  This category includes URLs of the file, http,
https, and ftp schemes, to name a few.  Standard URLs start the
resource specifier with two slashes ("//"), and can be broken into
four distinct pieces - the scheme, the net location, the path, and
further resource specifiers (typically an optional parameter, query,
and/or fragment).  The net location appears immediately following
the two slashes and goes up to the next slash; it's format is
scheme-specific, but is usually composed of some or all of a username,
password, host name, and port.  The path is a series of path components
separated by slashes; if the net location is present, the path always
begins with a slash.  Standard URLs can be relative to another URL,
in which case at least the scheme and possibly other pieces as well
come from the base URL (see RFC 1808 for precise details when resolving
a relative URL against its base).  The full URL is therefore

<scheme> "://" <net location> <path, always starting with slash> <add'l resource specifiers>

If a given CFURL can be decomposed (that is, conforms to RFC 1808), you
can ask for each of the four basic pieces (scheme, net location, path,
and resource specifer) separately, as well as for its base URL.  The
basic pieces are returned with any percent escape sequences still in
place (although note that the scheme may not legally include any
percent escapes); this is to allow the caller to distinguish between
percent sequences that may have syntactic meaning if replaced by the
character being escaped (for instance, a '/' in a path component).
Since only the individual schemes know which characters are
syntactically significant, CFURL cannot safely replace any percent
escape sequences.  However, you can use
CFURLCreateStringByReplacingPercentEscapes() to create a new string with
the percent escapes removed; see below.

If a given CFURL can not be decomposed, you can ask for its scheme and its
resource specifier; asking it for its net location or path will return NULL.

To get more refined information about the components of a decomposable
CFURL, you may ask for more specific pieces of the URL, expressed with
the percent escapes removed.  The available functions are CFURLCopyHostName(),
CFURLGetPortNumber() (returns an Int32), CFURLCopyUserName(),
CFURLCopyPassword(), CFURLCopyQuery(), CFURLCopyParameters(), and
CFURLCopyFragment().  Because the parameters, query, and fragment of an
URL may contain scheme-specific syntaxes, these methods take a second
argument, giving a list of characters which should NOT be replaced if
percent escaped.  For instance, the ftp parameter syntax gives simple
key-value pairs as "<key>=<value>;"  Clearly if a key or value includes
either '=' or ';', it must be escaped to avoid corrupting the meaning of
the parameters, so the caller may request the parameter string as

CFStringRef myParams = CFURLCopyParameters(ftpURL, CFSTR("=;%"));

requesting that all percent escape sequences be replaced by the represented
characters, except for escaped '=', '%' or ';' characters.  Pass the empty
string (CFSTR("")) to request that all percent escapes be replaced, or NULL
to request that none be.
